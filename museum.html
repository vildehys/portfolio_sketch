                            <h3>What</h3>
                            <p>- A lot of CSS fixes</p>
                            <p>- Font-sizes, and generally more responsive on mobile</p>
                            <p>- Improvements in WAVE, meta descriptions and alt texts</p>
                            <p>- HTML improvements</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="info2">
                            <h3>Why</h3>
                            <p>The page previously had a lot of CSS fixes, such as margin to the whole page and font sizes too small for smaller screens. These are now fixed.</p>
                            <p>HTML has also been improved, and use of CSS where shortcuts was previously made.</p>
                            <p>alternative texts has been added to images where missing, and contrasts between content has been taken into account. </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="info3">
                            <h3>Cons</h3>
                            <p>Would ideally like to make adjustments to the design, but prioritized JS for now. </p>
